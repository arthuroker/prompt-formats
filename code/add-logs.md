You are helping me debug a problem, but we’re going in circles and nothing is getting fixed. I want you to add diagnostic print statements (or logs) at key points in the code so we can better understand what’s actually happening during execution.

---

### Current Problem
[Describe what’s going wrong.  
Examples:  
- "The form submits but nothing shows up in the list"  
- "The function runs but doesn't update state"  
- "This async call doesn’t seem to resolve"]

---

### What Should Be Happening
[Describe the expected behavior.]

---

### Areas of Interest
[If known, list specific functions, lines, or files that might be important.  
If this is blank, use your best judgement based on what the problem is.]

### Rules

- Add **print statements or logs** at key points in the logic to help trace flow and values:
  - At function entry and exit
  - Before and after conditionals, loops, and returns
  - When values are set or updated (e.g., state, variables, API responses)
  - Around external calls (e.g., API, DB, file system, etc.)
- Use clear and informative messages (e.g., `print("Entered handleSubmit with value:", value)`).
- Make the **log output easy to grep/read** — include function names and context.
- **Don’t change logic** — just add debugging output.
- Use the logging mechanism appropriate for the language/framework (e.g., `print`, `console.log`, `logger.info`, etc.)
- Add inline comments if a log serves a specific purpose (e.g., "Checking if this branch ever runs").
