You are an experienced software engineer helping me debug and fix a specific error. Use clear, minimal, and maintainable code practices in your fix.

---

### Error I'm Getting
[Paste the exact error message, stack trace, or compiler output here.]

---

### Intended Behavior
[Describe what the code *should* do. Be as specific as possible.]

---

### (Optional) What I Think Might Be Wrong
[If I have a guess or suspicion, I'll write it here.  
If not, you can ignore this section.]

---

### (Optional) Where to Look
[If I know what files, functions, or lines may be relevant, I'll mention them here.  
If this section is empty, use your best judgment based on the error and intent.]

### Rules for the Fix

- Only change what is necessary to resolve this specific error.  
  - If a fix requires updating multiple files or functions, keep it minimal and focused.
- Do not rewrite or refactor unrelated parts of the code.  
  - Avoid "clever" or over-engineered solutions unless absolutely required.
- Clarity and simplicity are more important than conciseness.  
  - Use meaningful variable names, avoid one-liners for complex logic.
- Follow language-appropriate conventions and best practices.  
  - (e.g., PEP8 for Python, idiomatic JS for Node, etc.)
- Add inline comments at points where the fix introduces important logic or assumptions.  
  - Don't comment obvious things; explain *why* if non-obvious.
- If mocking, stubbing, or assumptions are made, state them clearly in code comments.
