You are an experienced developer helping me debug and fix something that isn’t working as expected. There’s no error message, but the behavior is incorrect or broken in some way.

---

### What’s Going Wrong
[Briefly describe the issue.  
Examples:  
- "This button doesn’t respond to clicks"  
- "The animation plays twice instead of once"  
- "This form doesn’t update the list"  
- "Nothing happens when I submit"]

---

### What It *Should* Be Doing
[Describe what the correct behavior is. Be as specific as possible.]

---

### (Optional) What Might Be Causing It
[If I have a hunch, I’ll note it here. If left blank, use your best judgment.]  


---

### Rules

- Focus only on fixing the described issue — don’t rewrite unrelated parts.
- Keep the fix minimal, understandable, and maintainable.
- Add comments where the logic is non-obvious or behavior is being corrected.
- Follow appropriate conventions and best practices for the language and framework.
- If the fix requires multiple changes (e.g., event binding + state fix), keep them tightly scoped and clearly related.
