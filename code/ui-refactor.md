### Rules

- Improve the **visual style, layout, and user experience** of the component.
- Preserve **existing functionality and behavior** unless a small change clearly improves usability.
- Keep changes **modular and minimal** — don’t refactor or restructure unrelated code.
- Follow **clean, modern design principles**: alignment, spacing, contrast, balance.
- Use animations if they **enhance clarity or fluidity**
- Use **clear comments** if changes involve non-obvious design decisions.
- Stick to the **current tech stack** and conventions unless told otherwise.
- **Simple, readable, and maintainable** code is the priority.
